Current hiccups:
1. Highlighting primitives composed of words (e.g. true false).
2. First element in a list of symbols is treated as syntax and highlighted.
3. Formatting.

To implement:
1. Errors // done
2. Evaluation history hud with highlighting. 
3. Terminal input symbol.
4. Loading screen.
5. nREPL server inception and destruction.
6. Pre-loaded function for downloading artifacts and binding them.

To consider:
1. Group selection. For group deletion, copying and pasting.
2. Mouse support.
3. Parens-oriented editing. (would facilitate slurping)
4. Project integration.

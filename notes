One of the first things that I need to figure out is
how to write a console editor, or a shell editor.
Starting an application directly might be easy,
but integrating the thing in the console is the thing
I am not so sure about.
I'll have to look into this. I do hope I shall not need
to actually write bash code. I do not plan on writing a text
editor in bash.

One of the things that I may have to do however, is build
the whole editor around `Scanner.In`. I do hope however there
are alternatives to this. I do not want to actually make this
dependent on `Scanner`.

Wait a second.
In essence, in order to do this, I have to create an application
that manipulates the input and output streams directly.

It continously  handles the input stream, stores data into a buffer etc.
and then spits it out to the output stream in some transformed way.
That output I determine. In my case it would be highlighted, formatted
and multi-lined.

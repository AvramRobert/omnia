CURRENT TASK:

Move all events to the `events` namespace

Global issues:
1. Move all events to the `events` namespace. Write functions for creating them.
2. Rename events after what they do, not what the keys generally associated with these operations do.
3. Use events from #2 in tests directly with the `process` function of the input or context
4. Rewrite tests using deftest and the more straightforward concept of `from-marked-text`. (context, text, render, nrepl)
5. Remove `from-cursored-string` and `from-string`
6. Chuck away most of the context helpers from `test-utils` after simplifying tests using `from-marked-text`.

omnia.text.core issues:
  - Remove `initial-region`, merge with `adjust-against`, move implementation to `select-with`
  - Remove adjoin and join. adjoin is not append and is variable arity. Make join the same.
  - Rename the functions in text.core to something more straightforward (break -> new-line etc.)
  - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives) (peer [previous current next])
  - Use reset-to [cursor] as a main to change positions. Make that bound properly. Remove move-x move-y
  - Patch chunk-delete, make it more efficient
  - rename region coordinates "from" and "until" instead of "start" "end"
  - the `omnia.text-test/matches-parens` test doesn't really check the selected regions. It should.
  - debug-string should also display the selection and cursor

omnia.text.syntax issues:
  - Add previous node to transition evaluator of syntax highlighter
    -> can be part of the transition function of every node. Should allow me to make context-based transitions
  - Fix number highlighter based on #2
  - Add set-highlighting

omnia.repl.context issues:
  - Remove config from context. Use a separate parameter to the functions

Finishing touches:

  - Rewrite README, replace logo, keep it a bit simple

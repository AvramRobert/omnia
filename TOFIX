CURRENT TASK:

The highlighter is fucking broken because I forgot to add the exclusive printing
of subregions when printing a line in `omnia.view.render/print-line`.
The technical diffing mechanism in the context works (finally), the problem
lies in the actual printing to the screen.

When cleaning highlights, the entire line gets newly printed in order
to recreate proper syntax highlighting when cleaning up.
That printing of the entire line does not (yet) support only actually putting
certain chars on the screen and ignoring others.
So even though the whole entire system works, i.e: calculating the correct region,
culling the garbage so that only the necessary gets printed, the fucking print-line
goes ahead and recreates THE ENTIRE FUCKING LINE.

As far as i remember, i had actually written this to do somewhere, but've forgotten.
Fucking idiot.
That's the problem with these fucking highlights.

0. Fix selection issue in text.core (details found in omnia.text-test(line:578))
    - Remove `initial-region`, merge with `adjust-against`, move implementation to `select-with`
    - Rewrite the entire tests in text.test using simpler concepts
    - Check to see if everything still works afterwards
    - Remove adjoin and join. adjoin is not append and is variable arity. Make join the same.
    - Rename the functions in text.core to something more straightforward (break -> new-line etc.)
    - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives)
        (peer [previous current next])
    - Use reset-to [cursor] as a main to change positions. Make that bound properly. Remove move-x move-y
    - Change the end-selection function in text.core to take into account the cursor selection error
    - Patch chunk-delete, make it more efficient
    - Use process' with events for text tests
    - Replace process' and process with the proper `process` functions from the core and context namespaces
    - debug-string should also display the selection and cursor
    - rename region coordinates "from" and "until" instead of "start" "end"
    - the `omnia.text-test/matches-parens` test doesn't really check the selected regions. It should.
    - use `with-marked-text` everywhere. Instead of `from-string` or `from-cursored-string`

1. Fix highlighting issue specified in omnia.repl-test (line:530)
2. Fix tests for highlighting in that file
3. Fix print-line to include sub-regions in omnia.view.render (line:78)
4. Write additional tests if necessary
5. Add previous node to transition evaluator of syntax highlighter
    -> can be part of the transition function of every node. Should allow me to make context-based transitions
6. Fix number highlighter based on #5
7. Possibly add set-highlighting
8. Remove config from context. Use a separate parameter to the functions

CURRENT TASK:
  * Write a `resets-docs` test for the context

Global issues:
 * Add rendering strategy to the context

omnia.repl.docs issues:
  - The docs can only occur one at a time. Why not just keep one entry that switches types,
  instead of a map that has three of them?

omnia.repl.text issues:
  - debug-string should also display the selection and cursor
  - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives) (peer [previous current next])
  - Reverse parameter order?

omnia.display.terminal issues:
  - Fix lanterna deprecation of `TextCharacter`

Finishing touches:
  - Rewrite README, replace logo, keep it a bit simple

CURRENT TASK:
The change in selection behaviour has influenced how parens pairs are interpreted.
The selection goes up until the `end` (exclusive)
When `i/find-pair` - the expansion goes until the `end` (exclusive)
which means that the pair itself is not where the `end` is, but behind it.!
See comment in omnia.text.core:754

0. Fix selection issue in text.core (details found in omnia.text-test(line:578))
    - Remove `initial-region`, merge with `adjust-against`, move implementation to `select-with`
    - Rewrite the entire tests in text.test using simpler concepts
    - Check to see if everything still works afterwards
    - Remove adjoin and join. adjoin is not append and is variable arity. Make join the same.
    - Rename the functions in text.core to something more straightforward (break -> new-line etc.)
    - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives)
        (peer [previous current next])
    - Use reset-to [cursor] as a main to change positions. Make that bound properly. Remove move-x move-y
    - Change the end-selection function in text.core to take into account the cursor selection error
    - Patch chunk-delete, make it more efficient
    - Use process' with events for text tests
    - Replace process' and process with the proper `process` functions from the core and context namespaces
    - debug-string should also dispaly the selection and cursor
    - rename region coordinates "from" and "until" instead of "start" "end"

1. Fix highlighting issue specified in omnia.repl-test (line:530)
2. Fix tests for highlighting in that file
3. Fix print-line to include sub-regions in omnia.view.render (line:78)
4. Write additional tests if necessary
5. Add previous node to transition evaluator of syntax highlighter
    -> can be part of the transition function of every node. Should allow me to make context-based transitions
6. Fix number highlighter based on #5
7. Possibly add set-highlighting
8. Remove config from context. Use a separate parameter to the functions

CURRENT TASK:

Global issues:

 * Separate current hud manipulations to a `hud` namespace
 * Create a separate "Context" data structure, that will replace "ProcessingStep"
 * Create a `context` namespace that basically implements each of the individual events and creates the `Context` data structure and delegates to hud
 * Put everything that is updated throughout the repl lifetime in the "ProcessingStep" as separate fields
 * Always create a new processing step, never assoc into it. That should make it work.
 * Add rendering strategy to the context
 * Give the hud a function with which it can enrich the input
   Almost everything that happens externally (like evaluation, history tracking etc) takes the input and replaces
   it with somethig else. A function that simply enriches the input can be the general way of adding something
   to the hud.
 * SHOULD I ACTUALLY DEFINE A FUNCTION `DERIVE-CONTEXT`, PATCH IT ALL OVER THE PLACE AND EXTRACT THE HUD IN EVERY TEST?
 * Move the nrepl creation in test-utils to `derive-context` (if there should be one)
 * I can define a schema that checks protocols properly. Replace all places that reference
   - omnia.display.terminal/Terminal with omnia.schema.terminal/Terminal

omnia.repl.text issues:
  - remove the text history from the text itself
        -> define a separate component that is carried recursively with the repl processing as a separate parameter.
        -> That way, the text won't become large and the transformations will be quick.
        -> Perhaps we can put the repl's evaluation history inside this construct aswell

  - the clipboard doesn't need to be a focken text, does it??!
  - the history doesn't need to have a focken clipboard either, does it??
    Come to think of it, the history needn't be a text either -_-
  - debug-string should also display the selection and cursor
  - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives) (peer [previous current next])
  - Reverse parameter order?

omnia.repl.context issues:
  - perhaps there is a way of removing the NReplClient from the Context

omnia.display.terminal issues:
  - Fix lanterna deprecation of `TextCharacter`

Finishing touches:
  - Rewrite README, replace logo, keep it a bit simple

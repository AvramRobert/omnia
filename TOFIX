CURRENT TASK:

Global issues:

omnia.repl.text issues:
  - remove the text history from the text itself
        -> define a separate component that is carried recursively with the repl processing as a separate parameter.
        -> That way, the text won't become large and the transformations will be quick.

  - rename region coordinates "from" and "until" instead of "start" "end"
  - the clipboard doesn't need to be a focken text, does it??!
  - the history doesn't need to have a focken clipboard either, does it??
    Come to think of it, the history needn't be a text either -_-
  - debug-string should also display the selection and cursor
  - Change the primitive hierarchy in the text.core implementation (enrich and probably peer are top primitives) (peer [previous current next])
  - Reverse parameter order?

omnia.repl.syntax issues:
  - Add previous node to transition evaluator of syntax highlighter
    -> can be part of the transition function of every node. Should allow me to make context-based transitions
  - Fix number highlighter:
       * (-> 1 ) => renders `->` in number colouring because `-` is part of the number node
       * if I keep track of what the previous state was, I can change the emission
  - Add set-highlighting

omnia.repl.context issues:
  - perhaps there is a way of removing the NReplClient from the Context

omnia.view.terminal issues:
  - Fix lanterna deprecation of `TextCharacter`

Finishing touches:
  - Rewrite README, replace logo, keep it a bit simple
